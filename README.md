# Smiley ![](/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png)

The power of a smile is enormous, even if no one sees when we smile. People who smile can learn and work more efficiently. Also people who do not smile do not succeed. People response a smile for a smile. It costs nothing, but it gives a lot.

If you feel that you are not able to smile right now, just force yourself to smile! Just as if you were already satisfied. It will make you happier. Happiness depends only on ourselves. People are as happy as they think they are. It is worth to have a habit of smiling.
